All files in this dir were creatd by calling `exp/wsj/create_character_decoding_graph.sh exp/wsj/lm_4k0c030a tmpwsjgraph`

The main file is LG.fst - the decoding graph, together with symbol tables chars.txt and words.txt.

The contents are:
G.fst - the grammar FST (words->words), i.e. the language model
G.pdf - a pdf view of G.fst
LG.fst - the decoding FST (characters->words) formed by composing L with G 
LG.pdf - the pdf view of LG.fst
LG_withsyms.fst - the fst with embedded symbol tables
L_disambig.fst - lexixon FST (characters->words) with disambiguation symbols added
L_disambig.pdf - pdf view of L.fst
README - this file
chars.txt - character symbol table for LG.fst (no disambiguation characters)
chars_disambig.txt - character symbol table with disambiguation characters for both L.fst and LG.fst
disambig.txt - list of disamboguation chars
lexicon.txt - autogenerated lexicon, formed by applying our data preprocessing rules to words from the LM
lexicon_disambig.txt - autogenerated lexicon with disambigation symbols
net-chars.txt - character symbol table used by the network (it is shifted by 1 with respect to the chars.txt)
words.txt - word symbol table, autogenerated
emit_a_space.fst - a small fst that prints a space, then copies its input to its output.
